# Mr.B's Gravitational Laboratory

Hello,welcome to Mr.B's Gravitational Laboratory or you can call it GAVLAB.

## What can you do in GAVLAB

Please don't be confused by its name because GAVLAB is not a real laboratory.
Actually it's a virtual laboratory running on computer, a program which can simulate 
the physical process or a system driven by gravitational force.

You can simulate any gravitational process because GAVLAB allows the users to
design their own system in the universe.
In this manual mode users have to set up all information of the system,including the planet's name,mass,radius,position,velocity and RGB color.
It's an exhausting task!

Besides manual mode there are another two automodes for the users who are too busy to set up the system manually.

The first choice is to simulate the real solar system with eight planets in it.
All data was provided by Professor Xue on the website.

The other choice is a little crazy.
It's random mode.
Random mode can generate any number of planets randomly in random position with random velocity and random mass and even random color.
Everything is random!
It means we can simulate hundreds of planets 
by typing several keys on the keyboard and then enjoy the universe and drink a cup of coffee.
It's convenient!

## How to run GAVLAB

The first step of running GAVLAB is easy:get a computer. More specifi- cally, a computer with UNIX based system such as Mac OS or Linux system. Unfortunately GAVLAB cannot run on Windows system because there
are a lot of libraries missing which I will list out later.

Anyway Macintosh is the best choice. On a Mac computer all you have to do
is double clicking the executable file named GAVLAB with the sun-shaped logo.
